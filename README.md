# So STBT

**Community Transparency & Support Coordinator**

Hi, I'm So STBT.  
I help maintain clear, calm, and factual communication between blockchain projects and their communities.

## Role in Quazenthor (QWBQ)
My responsibility is community support and transparency coordination — not marketing, not promotion, and not financial guidance.

### What I Do
- Answer community questions with verifiable information
- Redirect users to on-chain data instead of opinions
- Maintain respectful, educational discussion spaces
- Ensure all communications align with non-financial policies

I do not manage funds, tokens, or smart contracts.
